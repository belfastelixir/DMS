# DMS (Dead Man's Switch)

A simple OTP Application (and eventually an HTTP API) which enables short
circuiting when a service becomes unavailable.

_Used as a learning project for members of Belfast Elixir._

* Build:   `mix do deps.get, compile`
* Test:    `mix test`
* REPL:    `iex -S mix`
* Observe: `:observer.start`

## API Examples

```elixir
# Ping will register service with that id as alive
id = "my-svc-id"
DMS.ping(id) # => :pong
DMS.alive?(id) # => true ~ Service with id responds as alive
# After @timeout period and no further pings
DMS.alive?(id) # => false ~ Service with id responds as dead
```

```elixir
#Â An id which has never pinged will also respond as dead
false = DMS.alive?("another-svc-id") #=> false
```

## Checklist

- [x] Model a Service as a Process (`DMS.Service`)
- [x] Register Service against an `id` (`DMS.Servce.Registry`)
- [x] Add a supervisor for Service Process (`DMS.Service.Supervisor`)
- [x] Add `ping(id)` function which will init Service if doesn't exist
- [x] Add `alive?(id)` function which returns `true` if service alive otherwise `false`
- [x] Add timer to service process which will terminate the process if it hasn't been pinged within `@timeout`
- [ ] Add Documentation with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
- [ ] Add Credo & Dialyzer for linting and static analysis.
- [ ] Add API to set service as down (before timeout).
- [ ] Enhance `DMS.id` to contain service id and account token + hash it before use as key in `DMS.Servise.Registry`.
- [ ] Add HTTP API.
- [ ] Add Pub/Sub push based API to notify when service is down.
- [ ] Publish on HEX package manager.
